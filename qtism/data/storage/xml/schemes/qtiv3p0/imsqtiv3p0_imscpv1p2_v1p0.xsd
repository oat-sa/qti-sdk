            Version:        3.0
            Status:         Candidate Final
            Description:    This is the QTIv3.0 profile of the IMS CPv1.2 specification. This is a normative
                            representation of the IMS CP 1.2 Information Model for binding purposes.  Read
                            the corresponding IMS CP Information Model for the Platform Independent Model
                            representation.

                ons of a metadata element. The schema and schemaversion children define the kind or colle-
                ction of metadata models being used.
