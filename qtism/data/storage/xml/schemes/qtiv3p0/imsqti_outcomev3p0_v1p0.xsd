            Schematron Strict Selection Validation Rules
            ============================================
            This is the set of Schematron rules that have been created to enforce the use of the "Unordered" stereotype.
            These rules ensure that the number of entries in an unordered complexType of an element obey the multiplicity constraints.
            This is required so that any-order/any-multiplicity complexTypes can be constructed and validated.

            This is the set of Schematron rules that have been created to enforce the validation constraints on namespaced extensions.
            These rules ensure that the names of the extension features conform to defined naming convention (expressed using a REGEX).
            At present these rules are limited to permitted names for the proprietary XML attributes.

                Outcome variables are declared by outcome declarations. Their value is set either from a
                default given in the declaration itself or by a responseRule during responseProcessing. I-
                tems that declare a numeric outcome variable representing the candidate's overall perform-
                ance on the item should use the outcome name 'SCORE' for the variable. SCORE needs to be a
                float. Items that declare a maximum score (in multiple response choice interactions, for
                example) should do so by declaring the 'MAXSCORE' variable. MAXSCORE needs to be a float.
                Items or tests that want to make the fact that the candidate scored above a predefined th-
                reshold available as a variable should use the 'PASSED' variable. PASSED needs to be a bo-
                olean. At runtime, outcome variables are instantiated as part of an item session. Their v-
                alues may be initialized with a default value and/or set during responseProcessing. If no
                default value is given in the declaration then the outcome variable is initialized to NULL
                unless the outcome is of a numeric type (integer or float) in which case it is initialized
                to 0. Declared outcomes with numeric types should indicate their range of possible values
                using normalMaximum and normalMinimum, especially if this range differs from [0,1].

                                A base-type is simply a description of a set of atomic values (atomic to this specificati-
                                on). Note that several of the base-types used to define the runtime data model have ident-
                                ical definitions to those of the basic data types used to define the values for attributes
                                in the specification itself. The use of an enumeration to define the set of base-types us-
                                ed in the runtime model, as opposed to the use of classes with similar names, is designed
                                to help distinguish between these two distinct levels of modelling.
