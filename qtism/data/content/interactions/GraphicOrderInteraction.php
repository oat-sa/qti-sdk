 * A graphic order interaction is a graphic interaction with a corresponding set
 * of choices that are defined as areas of the graphic image. The candidate's
 * task is to impose an ordering on the areas (hotspots). The order hotspot
 * interaction should only be used when the spacial relationship of the choices
 * with respect to each other (as represented by the graphic image) is important
 * to the needs of the item. Otherwise, orderInteraction should be used instead
 * with separate material for each option.
 *
 * The delivery engine must clearly indicate all defined area(s) of the image.
 *
 * The order hotspot interaction must be bound to a response variable with a
 * baseType of identifier and ordered cardinality.
