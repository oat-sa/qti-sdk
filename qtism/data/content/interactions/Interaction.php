/**
 * From IMS QTI:
 *
 * Interactions allow the candidate to interact with the item. Through an interaction, the candidate
 * selects or constructs a response. The candidate's responses are stored in the response variables.
 * Each interaction is associated with (at least) one response variable.
 *
 * The state of the interaction is used to set the value of the associated response variable.
 * The declaration of the associated response variable constrains the value of the response
 * to be of a particular baseType and cardinality. Some interactions impose additional constraints
 * on the set of allowable responses, for example, through constraining the minimum and/or maximum
 * number of choices that can be selected in a choiceInteraction. In some interactive delivery
 * engines it is possible to check these constraints while the candidate is interacting with the item.
 * As the candidate navigates around a test they may see an indication of which items have valid responses
 * and which require attention, or the candidate may be prevented from progressing through a test until a
 * valid response has been selected/constructed. (See validateResponses for how to enforce this mode of
 * operation during a test.) In some cases, delivery engines may even provide interactive controls that
 * eliminate certains types of invalid response, for example, by restricting the number of choices that
 * can be selected to prevent it exceeding the maximum specified for the interaction.
 *
 * Given the possibility that a candidate may place an interaction into a state that does not satisfy
 * these additional constraints, item authors must ensure that the response processing rules (if provided)
 * deal appropriately with invalid values of the response variables.
 *
 * The current version of the specification does not support the embedding of interactions in other
 * interactions. This may change in future versions of the specification.
