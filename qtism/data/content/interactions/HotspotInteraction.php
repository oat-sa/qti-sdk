 * A hotspot interaction is a graphical interaction with a corresponding set of
 * choices that are defined as areas of the graphic image. The candidate's task is
 * to select one or more of the areas (hotspots). The hotspot interaction should
 * only be used when the spacial relationship of the choices with respect to each
 * other (as represented by the graphic image) is important to the needs of the item.
 * Otherwise, choiceInteraction should be used instead with separate material for
 * each option.
 *
 * The delivery engine must clearly indicate the selected area(s) of the image and
 * may also indicate the unselected areas as well. Interactions with hidden
 * hotspots are achieved with the selectPointInteraction.
 *
 * The hotspot interaction must be bound to a response variable with a baseType
 * of identifier and single or multiple cardinality.
