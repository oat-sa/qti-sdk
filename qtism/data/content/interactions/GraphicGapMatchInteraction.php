/**
 * From IMS QTI:
 *
 * A graphic gap-match interaction is a graphical interaction with a set of gaps that are
 * defined as areas (hotspots) of the graphic image and an additional set of gap choices
 * that are defined outside the image. The candidate must associate the gap choices with
 * the gaps in the image and be able to review the image with the gaps filled in context,
 * as indicated by their choices. Care should be taken when designing these interactions
 * to ensure that the gaps in the image are a suitable size to receive the required gap
 * choices. It must be clear to the candidate which hotspot each choice has been associated
 * with. When associated, choices must appear wholly inside the gaps if at all possible and,
 * where overlaps are required, should not hide each other completely. If the candidate
 * indicates the association by positioning the choice over the gap (e.g., drag and drop)
 * the system should 'snap' it to the nearest position that satisfies these requirements.
 *
 * The graphicGapMatchInteraction must be bound to a response variable with base-type
 * directedPair and multiple cardinality. The choices represent the source of the pairing
 * and the gaps in the image (the hotspots) the targets. Unlike the simple gapMatchInteraction,
 * each gap can have several choices associated with it if desired, furthermore, the same
 * choice may be associated with an associableHotspot multiple times, in which case the
 * corresponding directed pair appears multiple times in the value of the response variable.
