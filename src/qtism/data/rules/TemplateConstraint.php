/**
 * A TemplateRule aiming at expressing constraints to Cloning Engines.
 *
 * From IMS QTI:
 *
 * By using a templateConstraint, authors can ensure that the values of variables set during
 * templateProcessing satisfy the condition specified by the boolean expression. For example,
 * two randomly selected numbers might be required which have no common factors.
 *
 * A templateConstraint may occur anywhere as a child of templateProcessing. It may not be
 * used as a child of any other element. Any number of templateConstraints may be used, though
 * two or more consecutive templateConstraints could be combined using the 'and' element to
 * combine their boolean expressions.
 *
 * The maximum number of times that the operations preceding the templateConstraint can be expected
 * to be performed is assumed to be 100; implementations may permit more iterations, but there must
 * be a finite maximum number of iterations. This prevents the occurrence of an endless loop.
 * It is the responsibility of the author to provide default values for any variables assigned
 * under a templateConstraint.
