/**
 * From IMS QTI
 *
 * A branch-rule is a simple expression attached to an assessmentItemRef, assessmentSection
 * or testPart that is evaluated after the item, section or part has been presented to
 * the candidate. If the expression evaluates to true the test jumps forward to the item,
 * section or part referred to by the target identifier. In the case of an item or section,
 * the target must refer to an item or section in the same testPart that has not yet been
 * presented. For testParts, the target must refer to another testPart.
 *
 * [Comment] The above definition restricts the navigation paths through a linear test
 * part to being trees. In other words, cycles are not allowed. In most cases, repitition
 * can be achieved by using a section that selects withReplacement up to a suitable upper
 * bound of repitition in combination with a preCondition or branchRule that terminates
 * the section early when (or if) a certain outcome has been achieved. (This technique
 * might be used in conjunction with one or more Item Templates to achieve drill and
 * practice, for example.) However, unbounded repitition is not supported. Comments
 * are sought on whether this approach is too restrictive.
