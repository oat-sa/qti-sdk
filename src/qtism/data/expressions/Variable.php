/**
 * From IMS QTI:
 *
 * This expression looks up the value of an itemVariable that has been declared in a
 * corresponding variableDeclaration or is one of the built-in variables. The result
 * has the base-type and cardinality declared for the variable subject to the type
 * promotion of weighted outcomes (see below).
 *
 * During outcomes processing, values taken from an individual item session can be looked
 * up by prefixing the name of the item variable with the identifier assigned to the item
 * in the assessmentItemRef, separated by a period character. For example, to obtain the
 * value of the SCORE variable in the item referred to as Q01 you would use a variable
 * instance with identifier Q01.SCORE.
 *
 * In adaptive tests that contain items that are allowed to be replaced (i.e. that have the
 * withReplacement attribute set to "true"), the same item can be instantiated more than once.
 * In order to access the outcome variable values of each instantiation, a number that denotes
 * the instance's place in the sequence of the item's instantiation is inserted between the
 * item variable identifier and the item variable, separated by a period character. For example,
 * to obtain the value of the SCORE variable in the item referred to as Q01 in its second
 * instantiation you would use a variable instance, prefixed by the instantiation sequence
 * number, prefixed by an identifier Q01.2.SCORE.
 *
 * When looking up the value of a response variable it always takes the value assigned to it
 * by the candidate's last submission. Unsubmitted responses are not available during expression
 * evaluation.
 *
 * The value of an item variable taken from an item instantiated multiple times from the
 * same assessmentItemRef (through the use of selection withReplacement) is taken from
 * the last instance submitted if submission is simultaneous, otherwise it is undefined.
