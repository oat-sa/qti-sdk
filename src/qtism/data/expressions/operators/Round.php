/**
 * From IMS QTI:
 *
 * The round operator takes a single sub-expression which must have single cardinality
 * and a numerical base-type. The result is a value of base-type integer formed
 * by rounding the value of the sub-expression. The result is the integer n for
 * all input values in the range [n-0.5,n+0.5). In other words, 6.8 and 6.5 both
 * round up to 7, 6.49 rounds down to 6 and -6.5 rounds up to -6. If the
 * sub-expression is NULL then the operator results in NULL. If the
 * sub-expression is NaN, then the result is NULL. If the sub-expression
 * is INF, then the result is INF. If the sub-expression is -INF, then
 * the result is -INF.
