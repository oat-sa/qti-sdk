 * From IMS QTI:
 *
 * The match operator takes two sub-expressions which must both have the same base-type
 * and cardinality. The result is a single boolean with a value of true if the two
 * expressions represent the same value and false if they do not. If either
 * sub-expression is NULL then the operator results in NULL.
 *
 * The match operator must not be confused with broader notions of equality such as
 * numerical equality. To avoid confusion, the match operator should not be used to
 * compare subexpressions with base-types of float and must not be used on
 * sub-expressions with a base-type of duration.
