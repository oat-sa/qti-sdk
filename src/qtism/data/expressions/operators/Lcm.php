 * integer and may have single, multiple or ordered cardinality. The result
 * is a single integer equal in value to the lowest common multiple (lcm) of
 * the argument values. If any argument is zero, the result is 0, lcm(0,n)=0;
 * authors should beware of this in calculations which require division by the
 * lcm of random values. If any of the sub-expressions is NULL, the result is NULL.
 * If any of the sub-expressions is not a numerical value, then the result is NULL.
