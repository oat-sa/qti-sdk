/**
 * From IMS QTI:
 *
 * The ordered operator takes 0 or more sub-expressions all of which must have
 * either single or ordered cardinality. Although the sub-expressions may be of
 * any base-type they must all be of the same base-type. The result is a container
 * with ordered cardinality containing the values of the sub-expressions,
 * sub-expressions with ordered cardinality have their individual values
 * added (in order) to the result: contains cannot contain other containers.
 * For example, when applied to A, B, {C,D} the ordered operator results
 * in {A,B,C,D}. Note that the ordered operator never results in an empty
 * container. All sub-expressions with NULL values are ignored. If no
 * sub-expressions are given (or all are NULL) then the result is NULL
