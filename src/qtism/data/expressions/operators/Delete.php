 * The delete operator takes two sub-expressions which must both have the same
 * base-type. The first sub-expression must have single cardinality and the
 * second must be a multiple or ordered container. The result is a new container
 * derived from the second sub-expression with all instances of the first
 * sub-expression removed. For example, when applied to A and {B,A,C,A} the
 * result is the container {B,C}. If either sub-expression is NULL the result
 * of the operator is NULL.
 *
 * The restrictions that apply to the member operator also apply to the
 * delete operator.
