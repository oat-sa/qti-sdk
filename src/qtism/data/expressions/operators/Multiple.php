 * From IMS QTI:
 *
 * The multiple operator takes 0 or more sub-expressions all of which must
 * have either single or multiple cardinality. Although the sub-expressions
 * may be of any base-type they must all be of the same base-type. The
 * result is a container with multiple cardinality containing the values
 * of the sub-expressions, sub-expressions with multiple cardinality have
 * their individual values added to the result: containers cannot contain
 * other containers. For example, when applied to A, B and {C,D} the
 * multiple operator results in {A,B,C,D}. All sub-expressions with NULL
 * values are ignored. If no sub-expressions are given (or all are NULL)
 * then the result is NULL.
