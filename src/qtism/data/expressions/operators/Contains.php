/**
 * From IMS QTI:
 *
 * The contains operator takes two sub-expressions which must both have the same
 * base-type and cardinality - either multiple or ordered. The result is a single
 * boolean with a value of true if the container given by the first sub-expression
 * contains the value given by the second sub-expression and false if it doesn't.
 * Note that the contains operator works differently depending on the cardinality
 * of the two sub-expressions. For unordered containers the values are compared
 * without regard for ordering, for example, [A,B,C] contains [C,A]. Note
 * that [A,B,C] does not contain [B,B] but that [A,B,B,C] does. For ordered
 * containers the second sub-expression must be a strict sub-sequence within
 * the first. In other words, [A,B,C] does not contain [C,A] but it does
 * contain [B,C].
 *
 * If either sub-expression is NULL then the result of the operator is NULL. Like
 * the member operator, the contains operator should not be used on sub-expressions
 * with a base-type of float and must not be used on sub-expressions with a base-type
 * of duration.
