/**
 * From IMS QTI:
 * 
 * Fragments are included using the Xinclude mechanism. (See [XINCLUDE].) The instance of include is treated as if 
 * it was actually an instance of the root element of the fragment referred to by the href attribute of the include 
 * element. For the purposes of this specification the xpointer mechanism defined by the XInclude specification must 
 * not be used. Also, all included fragments must be treated as parsed xml.
 * 
 * This technique is similar to the inclusion of media objects (using object) but allows the inclusion of data that 
 * conforms to this specification, specifically, it allows the inclusion of interactions, static content, processing 
 * rules or, at test level whole sections, to be included from externally defined fragments.
 * 
 * When including externally defined fragments the content of the fragment must satisfy the requirements of the 
 * specification in the context of the item in which it is being included. For example, interactions included 
 * from fragments must be correctly bound to response variables declared in the items.
